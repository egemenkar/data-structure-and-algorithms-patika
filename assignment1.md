# Project 1

Insertion Sort

[22,27,16,2,18,6]

1. Write the stages of the above sequence according to the sort type.

Stage 1 -> [16,22,27,2,18,6]
Stage 2 -> [2,16,22,27,18,6]
Stage 3 -> [2,16,18,22,27,6]
Stage 4 -> [2,6,16,18,27,22]

2. Write the Big-O notation.

O(n^2)

3. Time Complexity: Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle, Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end, Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the series.

Best case: O(n) = O(6)
Average case: O(n^2) = O(36)
Worst case: O(n^2) = 0(36)

4. What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted?

Average case



Write the first 4 steps of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15.6] according to Insertion Sort.

Step 1 -> [3,7,5,8,2,9,4,15,6]
Step 2 -> [3,5,7,8,2,9,4,15,6]
Step 3 -> [2,3,5,7,8,9,4,15,6]
Step 4 -> [2,3,4,5,7,8,9,15,6]
